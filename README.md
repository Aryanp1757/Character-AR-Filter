# Character-AR-Filter
I have created a Character Based Augmented Reality (AR) application . In that filter you can see character with their materials swords and RPG game costume. This is my first AR filter I have made ğŸ™‚ . As you can see that looks simple filter. whenever you tap on screen that generate another character on screen.
